langworld
=========

Langword is an RPG game engine for learning languages.
It is currently in early development stage.
It will be free software released under the GPL.
Currently it is using the pygame game library and danc's free 
"planet cute" tileset for graphics.

The purpose of the engine is to allow fast prototyping of RPG games 
where players control a protagonist and interact with a world using
language skills to navigate and succeed in that world.

For example, other characters will speak to the protagonist and s/he
would have to converse using correct vocabulary and grammar.

The protoganist will also have to use his/her linguistic skills
to make money, buy food, and avoid conflict.

Success in the game would be the accumulation of points.
Loss would be the deterioration of money or health.
These are just examples. The engine will be flexible enough
to create various objectives.
